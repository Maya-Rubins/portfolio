                        I have always been impressed by how much of an impact thoughtful design has on the world around us. Whether it comes from simplifying an interaction or by listening to user needs. I love creating visualy appealing and functional products that make people happy. I have spent the last few years designing food in a kitchen, listening to customer needs, learning languages, and what it takes to become a UX designer!

                        <p>
                        Oustside of designing I like to spend time with my family and friends, listening to music, drinking coffee, cooking, traveling, running, playing or watching soccer, and constantly exploring the world around me. :)
